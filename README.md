# Unity_Indirect-Rendering-With-Compute-Shaders
GPU-Driven demo in Unity
Fork from https://github.com/ellioman/Indirect-Rendering-With-Compute-Shaders, the version of witch is 4 May 2019.
The project is perfect for GPU-Driven testing, but it is a pity that maintenance stopped long time ago. Respect to the author ellioman.

Indirect Rendering With Compute Shaders
========

An example of rendering numerous instances in Unity3D using Compute shaders for culling and LOD'ing and Graphics.DrawMeshInstancedIndirect to draw.

## Features

- Tested on Metal (Mac) and D3D11.
- Quasirandom squences to place the instances
- Draw things using Graphics.DrawMeshInstancedIndirect
- GPU Sorting with Bitonic sorting
- Compute shader: Frustum and shadow caster culling 
- Compute shader: Occlusion culling with HierarchicalZBuffer
- Compute shader: Detail (Screen Size) Culling
- Compute shader: LOD objects using the distance from camera to object
- Simple shadow mode: Only use one shadow mesh for each instance type to lower setpass calls

## Project Setup
- "_Example.cs" script on the "Example" game object:
	- Creates the instance data and sends it to the Indirect Renderer class.
- "IndirectRenderer.cs" on the "MainCamera" game object:
	- Is the main class in the project. It initializes all the buffers and compute shaders and then dispatches the compute shaders and draws the objects when Unity calls the PreCull() function.
- "HiZBuffer.cs" script on the "OccluderCamera" game object:
	- Creates a hierarchial Z-Buffer texture that contains the depth texture and shadow map which are used when doing frustum and occlusion culling

## TODO
- Add reprojection of last frameâ€™s depth to the Hi-Z (See "GPU-Driven Rendering Pipelines" below)
- Improve the instance sorting:
	- On my Macbook pro (mid 2014) sorting takes approx 50% of the GPU time
	- The GPU sorting must support instance numbers that are not in the non power of two 
	- Find a better performant approach for the CPU Sorting
- Create the Hi-Z Texture with compute shaders
- Try out Raster Occlusion instead of Hi-Z (See "NVidia Siggraph 2014" & "Github - nvpro-samples" below)
